A Command-Line Rust Application for restricticting access inserted websites. The general idea is to aid command-line programmers, who may be easily distracted from their tasks. 
A user simply inputs the websites they don't want to access and my application does that rest. 
This will help users stay focused on their task at hand. It may also help other users who maybe addicted to social media scrolling, or general internet addiction.

Additionally, there are two distinct features incorporated into the program; the first one is a confirmation prompt before restricting a website, and the second is using regular expression to make sure the website entered, either begins with "https://" or "http://". 
If the website inputted doesn't begin with any of those two expressions, the program will send out an error message and a prompt to enter the website URL correctly.
